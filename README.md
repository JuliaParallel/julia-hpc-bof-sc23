# Julia for HPC Birds of a Feather session @ SC23

This repository contains the brief talks presented during the the "[Julia for
HPC](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof232&sess=sess366)" Birds of a
Feather session at the
[SuperComputing23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/)
(SC23) conference held in Dallas (Denver, USA) on Thursday, 16 November 2023

## Survey

Please fill out our [Survey](https://forms.gle/4FZ8cdP9FfKCwLvT9). It will only take a
minute!

This survey aims to gauge the HPC community's usage of Julia â€“ as well as its future
interest in deploying Julia codes on HPC systems. We've been surveying the community for
over 2 years now, and hope to be able to identify trends. Therefore, even if you filled 
this or similar surveys out before, please do do again.

# Julia for HPC Birds of a Feather session @ SC23

This repository contains the brief talks presented during the the "[Julia for
HPC](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof232&sess=sess366)" Birds of a
Feather session at the
[SuperComputing23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/)
(SC23) conference held in Dallas (Denver, USA) on Thursday, 16 November 2023

## Survey

Please fill out our [Survey](https://forms.gle/4FZ8cdP9FfKCwLvT9). It will only take a
minute!

This survey aims to gauge the HPC community's usage of Julia â€“ as well as its future
interest in deploying Julia codes on HPC systems. We've been surveying the community for
over 2 years now, and hope to be able to identify trends. Therefore, even if you filled 
this or similar surveys out before, please do do again.

## Community

* The Julia Language, and the Julia for HPC communities are incredibly welcoming, for
more information, please check out the [Julia Community Pages](https://julialang.org/community/),
the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/),
and the [Julia Parallel](https://juliaparallel.org/) community. The Julia for HPC
community meets monthy on Zoom.

* This is an excellent intro-level course on using Julia in Scientific Computing:
[Solving PDEs in parallel on GPUs with Julia](https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch/)

## Agenda:

1. Technical program:

| Time | Speaker | Title |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 12:15 - 12:16 | Johannes Blaschke (NERSC) | Opening |
| 12:16 - 12:21 | Caira Anderson (Cornell) | [My experience with Julia as a novice scientific code developer and HPC user](Caira.pdf) |
| 12:21 - 12:26 | Pedro Valero Lara (ORNL) | [JACC.jl: On-node Performance Portable Programming Model in Julia](Pedro.pdf) |
| 12:26 - 12:31 | Sherry Li (LBNL) | [Julia interface for parallel sparse matrix factorization](Sherry.pdf) |
| 12:31 - 12:36 | Anton Smirnov (AMD) | State of AMD GPU programming in Julia |

2. Discussions from 12:36-1:15. Discussions moderated by Katharine Hyatt (AWS), William Godoy (ORNL), and You Wu (ETH)
